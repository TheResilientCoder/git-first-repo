Version control systems are used to manage the history of your code.
Before Git became mainstream, version control systems were used by developers
to manage their code. They were called SCCS (Source Code Control System). 
SCCS was a proprietary software that was used to manage the history of code. 
It was expensive and not very user-friendly.
Git was created to replace SCCS and to make version control more accessible
and user-friendly. Some commong version control systems
are Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.
